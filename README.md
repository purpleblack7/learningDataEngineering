# learningDataEngineering
These are my attempts to learn Data Engineering. They aren't original projects



Learning Spark -2 
############################
This was to get me familiar with using Spark. I created a different conda environment and ran the code there. Setting up a conda environment was something new and understanding how to query data on spark without using SQL statements was what I acheived.


Learning Snowflake
#######################
This provided a brief introduction to SnowFlake. The course was initially done on Windows with Azure, so I ran into a few troubles with SnowPipe. But the rest have been done

Learning Luigi
#######################
A fantastic course that brought me up to speed with Luigi.
