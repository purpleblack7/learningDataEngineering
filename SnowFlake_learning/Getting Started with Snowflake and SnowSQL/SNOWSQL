SNOWSQL

Step 1: Update the config file
    This is located in the Users folder ( just type cd and hit enter to get to the user directory ). 
    Use 'ls-a ' to see the hidden files. Cd to .snowsql
    Use 'nano config' to edit the configuration file for easy access to snowsql
    Fill in the values of account name (the first part of the url for SnowFlake Desktop before.snowflake....), username and password. Make sure to uncomment these lines and save the file


Step 2: Creating Tables 

type snowsql in the terminal

'!source /Users/purpleblack/Downloads/snowflake-cloud-data-platform-getting-started/03/demos/m3/CREATE TABLE SNOWSQL.txt'       # My location of the "CREATE TABLE SNOWSQL.txt" file.


USE Reviews; #Using the Reviews DB
SELECT * from BUSINESSES LIMIT 5; #Sample Query

'!source /Users/purpleblack/Downloads/snowflake-cloud-data-platform-getting-started/03/demos/m3/CREATE TABLE SNOWSQL.txt'

!define cityName='Las Vegas' # Creating a variable cityName with value 'Las Vegas'

!set variable_substitution=true #Variable subsitution allows you to query on a variable using th '&' prefix. Note that there is no space after the '=' sign

SELECT * FROM top_businesses WHERE city='&cityName'; #Example of Variable Substituiton. Searching for a city name of 'Las Vegas'

!set variable_substitution=false #If you set Variable Substitution to false, the query will look for the variable name literally.

SELECT * FROM top_businesses WHERE city='&cityName'; #Searching for a city name that is '&cityName'

!define partialName='Las ' #Creating a variable that has a partial form of 'Las Vegas' -> 'Las '

!set variable_substitution=true #Setting variable substituition to true

SELECT * FROM top_businesses WHERE city='&{partialName}Vegas'; #Query

!variables #To view a list of variables created 

!spool .\.snowsql\results.txt #Spooling saves the results of the query to a file which can be accessed locally. !spool tells when to start spooling. You need to provide the destination path

SELECT * FROM businesses limit 5; #Query to be spooled

!spool off #Spool off tells SnowSQL to stop spooling here.

!set output_format=csv #To change the output format from .txt to .csv

!set header=false #Removing headers

!set timing=false # timing specifies whether to display the number of rows produced and elapsed time for SQL statements that have executed. Removing that because it is unnecessary

!spool .\.snowsql\results.csv #spooling 

SELECT * from businesses limit 5; #query

!spool off #turning off spool

!queries session #Provides a list of queries made during this session along with a unique identifier for each query.

!result *************** #Get the result of a query executed. Replace ****** with the query ID

!quit #Quits the session


Step 3:
Using the Terminal to automatically run queries 

 snowsql -f /Users/purpleblack/Downloads/snowflake-cloud-data-platform-getting-started/03/demos/m3/SimpleQuery.txt -o output_file=./.snowsql/output.csv -o quiet=true -o friendly=false -o header=false -o output_format=csv
