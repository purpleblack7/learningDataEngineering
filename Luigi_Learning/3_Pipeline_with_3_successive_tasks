This code creates a pipeline with three successive tasks
There are three tasks:

      1)Process Orders: Writes orders to a target file 'orders.csv'
      
      2)Generate Report: Aggregates the sum of the orders for each month to a target file 'report.csv'.
                         This task waits for Process Orders to complete to start. Hence ProcessOrders is a dependency in the 'requires' stage.
       
      3)Summarize Report: Sums the rows of the Amount column
      
      Note that I haven't used the '--local-scheduler'. This is because I learnt about the LuigiUI feature at http://localhost:8082
