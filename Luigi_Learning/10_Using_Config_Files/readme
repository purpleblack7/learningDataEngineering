This code uses a config file instead of putting in input-file as a command in the terminal entry. 
The config file is found at luigi.cfg and it specifies the location of the input file for DownloadSalesData

This is what the command condenses to:  python 
   -m luigi --module using-config-files DownloadSalesData --local-scheduler


If I moved the config file to /tmp and renamed it as luigi_staging.cfg, the command to enter in the terminal would be:
  LUIGI_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp/luigi_staging.cfg python -m luigi --module using-config-files DownloadSalesData --local-scheduler
