This code takes in the input folder as a parameter, compared to what was done in the last unit. 
This makes the code more versatile as it is more convenient to specify the input folder rather than putting the input files in an 'input' folder


The code to enter in the terminal to run the program:

python -m luigi --module start-pipeline-parameters DownloadSalesData --input-folder kyu-kyu-input --local-scheduler

  * kyu-kyu-input is the name of the input folder
  * DownloadSalesDate is the end task
  * The variable 'input_folder' is used to take in the location of the input folder. However in the Terminal, the underscores are replaced with hyphens. Just a note to remember
